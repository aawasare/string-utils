# Tools used
 - **NodeJS with Typescript**: TypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented, compiled language which makes the app code more consistent clean, simple, testable and reusable.
 - **Jest**: It is an excellent unit testing option which provides great TypeScript support.
 - **Eslint**: Popular linting tool, partnering with prettier it really improves consistency and productivity of a development team.
 - **Prettier**: Prettier drastically improves team consistency by automatically formatting the code.
 - **Husky and lint-staged**: Used for pre-commit checks, to ensure all files committed to git don't have any linting or formatting errors.
